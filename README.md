# MyBeer

For the project I used the following frameworks : 

Dagger2 for DI

Retrofit for REST, I find so convinent his call adapters methods to convert json responses and the way he can integrate with RxJAva, makes life easier

RxJava2 for reactive

Glide for image loading

Butterknife for view Binding, I'm so used to work with butterknife, in conbination with the android studio plugin, it makes taking references from layouts so quick and easy.

Room for SqliteDb I used Room because it reduces the boilerplate code of SQlite, checks syntax, and again makes life easier.

I also implemented the Mvp patern to have a clear separation of concerns between components, keep the code cleaner and to try to follow the SOLID principles from Uncle's Bob.


_ _PS: Please be aware that I did the project while working 8 hour shift so I didn't have much time to spend on the layouts design, or making a Clean Architecture approach.
